## Introduction
We are Faizal, Jochem, Mitchell, Rens, Sander, Sander and for Semester 3 we are building a PIM system.

## Project description
WoC (World of Content) has given us, S3-DB02-1, the mission to create a mini PIM to our liking. We received some general information about WoC and started brainstorming from there.

We chose to focus on competition. This means the following:
p.s.: you can also take a look here at some user stories.

Starting with the suppliers:

the supplier (e.g. Sligro) has products that they want to sell. In order to sell to as many suppliers as possible, Sligro puts its products on our platform. There are many retailers on this system. For retailers, this is a great platform with a wide choice of products from different suppliers. This means a lot of competition between different suppliers.

Retailers:

The retailer (e.g. Jumbo) is looking for products. On this platform, Jumbo has a choice of different products with different brands, prices and stockpile. Jumbo uses this platform to make good choices between different suppliers.

Site Admins:

In addition to these 2 important roles, we naturally have the site owners (e.g. superadmins and more). They can also function as the staff of the PIM system. To give you an example: staff can provide customer support for both customers for problems and questions about the platform. Although this is important, we will focus less on this part.

All customers - suppliers and retailers - must have an account to access the platform's content. When creating an account, they can choose which role they have. If the customer chooses the retailer role, they will have access to all suppliers and retailers on the platform. The suppliers for what they deliver, and the retailers to, for example, look at basic statistics of others. A supplier will also have to be able to view the statistics of other suppliers in order to adjust its own, such as prices and delivery updates.
